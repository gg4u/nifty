# Nifty.works + ChainMap

Ref.

## Research questions
- Is information on blockchains and crypto insufficient to make decisions ?
- If so: 
-- what is missing => market research 
-- how does users make decisions => type of users
-- what kind of decision => users' scope / need

## Hypothesis
- Can knowledge maps help in decision making of crypto space ?
- TODO > define measurable things related to the decision making process

## What is missing
My interest is in appreciating and discerning about sustainability of blockchain based projects.
If I was to make an investment, I am interested in more on economics impact than financial impact.

George points out the opportunity to guide a person's interest in the blockchain space.
He points out the opportunity to use maps by taking customer intention first and then show them the map of relevant choices and highlights.

We discussed about key aspects to draft a first roadmap:
- can we make use of nifty.works maps applied on knowledge landscape of blockchain projects ?
- or dashboards may suffix ?
- or integrate both ?
- how shall we model a knowledge landscape of blockchain projects ?
-- ranking similiarity?
-- based on NLP news?
-- knowledge graph of crypto ? 

## Go backword
- What's missing VS [https://coinmarketcap.com/] and other projects (telegrams, etc.)?
- What a user wanna decide / what's the user interest ? (e.g. is it economics ? is it financial ? is it risk management ? ...)
- Map user behaviour onto tech functionalities
- what we have to code a functional tech architecture
